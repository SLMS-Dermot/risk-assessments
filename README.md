# South London Maker Space Risk Assessments

jcl/2016-07-31

At South London Maker Space we have many tools, most of which
need risk assessments in order to be safely and legally used.

This project contains

* The master copes of the risk assessements
* Some scripts for formatting them

The master copies were made by scripts from the original
shared spreadsheet, and are in Markdown format.

The layout of them for use is done into HTML via JSON.

The masters are in Markdown because non-technical people
need to edit them, most likely at Github online editor.

# How to remake the output files

 git pull origin master
 ./doit

# Where to put the output files

Ideally we want to put them on discourse.southlondonmakerspace.org,
however there are currently some formatting and logistical problems
in doing so.
