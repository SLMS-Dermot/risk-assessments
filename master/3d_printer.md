# Tool
3D Printer
# Induction
None
# Activity

* Making 3D objects from a digital file. The creation of a&nbsp;3D&nbsp;printed object achieved using additive processes. The object is created by laying down successive layers of filament plastic material until the entire object is created.
* 
* This risk assessment applies specifically to the use of the machine with PLA based filament.

# Personal Protective Equipment

* Signage: Hot surfaces + moving parts entrapment
* Signage: Only use PLA filament

# Procedure
## Before

* Tie back loose clothing and long hair, remove jewellery.
* Perform a visual inspection of machine for physical damage, especially power cables and connectors.
* Ensure the working area of the machine is free of obstructions that could become trapped in the machine.

## During

* Do not leave machine unattended during operation.
* Do not put hands or tools inside the machine during operation.
* Ensure only PLA filament is used in the machine.

## After

* After the printing process is complete the machine will automatically cool off, power off the machine at the back once the cooling fan has stopped.
* Clean up any mess.
