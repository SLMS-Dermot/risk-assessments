# Activity

* Routing is a high-speed process of cutting, trimming, and shaping wood, plastics, and a variety of other materials.
* Process characteristics
* 
* 1. Usually routing is limited to wood and soft materials (not metal)
* 2. Specially designed cutters are used for a variety of patterns, cuts, and edging.
* 3. Both hand controlled and machine controlled/aided routers are common today.
* 

# Personal Protective Equipment

* Eye protection, 
* Dust Mask or dust extraction
* Ear protection

# Procedure
## Before

* MUST have passed induction with written record
* Visually inspect machine, power cord and plug. 
* Ensure cutting bit is not damaged and is properly fitted to the tool
* Away from other users causing distraction or inhaling dust
* all loose items removed or tied back, entanglament hazard is high

## During

* Slow and steady feeding of material, sometimes making multiple passes to ensure amount of material removed is small enough to allow jamming free operation of the router
* Both hands to remain on the tool at all times
* never start the router until down over the well secured material
* never start the tool with the cutter in contact with the materal
* never lift the router until the motor has stopped

## After

* Clean work area
* unplug and stow tool

# Risk
