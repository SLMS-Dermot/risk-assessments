# Activity

* Routing is a high-speed process of cutting, trimming, and shaping wood using a high speed cutting spindle.
* A table allows use of a flat surface and guide fence to guide the workpiece past the spindle.
* 
* Process characteristics
* 
* 1. Usually routing is limited to wood and soft materials (not metal)
* 2. Specially designed cutters are used for a variety of patterns, cuts, and edging.
* 3. Both hand controlled and machine controlled/aided routers are common today.
* 
* Routing is a shaping process used to produce finished edges and shapes. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also be shaped using routers.

# Personal Protective Equipment

* Eye protection
* Dust mask or dust extraction
* Ear protection

# Procedure
## Before

* MUST have passed induction with written record
* Visually inspect machine, power cord and plug. 
* Ensure cutting bit is not damaged and is properly fixed in
* Away from other users causing distraction or inhaling dust
* all loose items removed or tied back, entanglament hazard is high
* ensure fence is secure
* simulate a pass with machine off to make sure enough space is clear

## During

* Slow and steady feeding of material, sometimes making multiple passes to ensure amount of material removed is enough to allow jamming free operation of the router
* Use correct feed direction (right to left when facing machine)
* Keep hands away from spindle or use push sticks/pallets

## After

* Clean work area
* unplug and stow tool

## Controls

* Loose clothing and long hair to be tied back.
* Jewellery to be removed.
* The router is unplugged when mounting bits or making major adjustments
* Before use a visual check should be carried out to ensure where applicable 
* all guards and covers are fitted, in good order and there are no visible faults 
* Tools are used in compliance with manufacturers instructions

## Who
Operator &amp; People in the vicinity
## Severity/Likelihood
Before 2-2 After 2-1
## Controls

## Severity/Likelihood
Before 3-5 After 3-1
## Controls

* Fence is securely clamped so that it will remain stationary during the routing operation
* A damaged cutter should not be used
* A slow and steady speed is to be used to allow the bit to remove the material easily.
* Feed in proper direction, ie opposite to blade rotation
* Use several passes for deep cuts
